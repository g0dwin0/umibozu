a simple (hopefully) gameboy (color) emulator.

## objective

get pokemon gold running!

## why?

you might be asking: "there are so many gameboy emulators out there! why make *another one*?"

the reason i'm making this is to **learn!**
i've always been intrigued by how emulators work, this would be an awesome learning experience.
