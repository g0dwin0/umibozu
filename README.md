a rudimentary gameboy emulator

## why?

you might be asking: "there are so many gameboy emulators out there! why make *another one*?"

the reason i'm making this is to **learn!**

i've always been intrigued by how emulators work, this would be an awesome learning experience.

## Resources


I used the following resources to create this emulator:

### [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
### [E. Haskins (DAA instruction)](https://ehaskins.com/2018-01-30%20Z80%20DAA/)
### [sm83-test-data](https://github.com/adtennant/sm83-test-data)


## Usage

Run `make check` to run the CPU tests.

## Binaries

Binaries are available in the Releases tab.
